          America, it works very well for swim platforms due to its ability to
          resist rot. Jatoba's color and grain is very similar to Teak and
          is often mistaken for Teak. It features a tan to salmon color with
          black accent stripes that over time turn to a deep and vibrant red.
          Jatoba is more dense than Teak and often outlasts teak when used for
          ski boat swim platforms.`}
