    "body": "Jatoba is a cost-effective alternative to Teak. Native to South America, it works very well for swim platforms due to its ability to resist rot. Jatoba's color and grain is very similar to Teak and is often mistaken for Teak. It features a tan to salmon color with black accent stripes that over time turn to a deep and vibrant red. Jatoba is more dense than Teak and often outlasts teak when used for ski boat swim platforms."
